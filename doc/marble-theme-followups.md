# Marble Theme Follow-ups

Deferred work on the Marble theme and the harness that verifies it. Items 1–5 are
concrete work steps converted from the 2026-07-22 process audit
(`doc/orchestrator-playbook-review.md`, since deleted); later items are added as they are
deferred, and name where the decision was taken. Each item is independent —
pick any up in a fresh session. When an item ships, delete its section here and
update the cross-references it names.

## 1. Brand-flip regression project

Goal: prove the theme recolors end-to-end when a customer overrides the seed token.
The per-component `x-brand-decl` check guards declarations only; nothing tests the
cascade (`doc/spec/brand-override.md`) across real pages.

- [ ] Add a `brand-flip` project to `src/test/playwright/playwright.config.ts`.
- [ ] New spec `brand-flip.spec.ts`: load representative pages (e.g. `button.zul`,
      `checkbox.zul`, `tabbox.zul`), inject
      `:root { --zk-color-primary: <distinct seed hue> }` via `addStyleTag` before
      measuring, `await document.fonts.ready`.
- [ ] Assert via computed styles, not screenshots: primary button background, checked
      checkbox/radio fill, tab indicator, and focus-ring color all shift hue with the
      injected seed (containers/overlays derive via `oklch(from …)` — assert the hue
      moved, not exact channel values).
- [ ] Add npm script `test:brand-flip` mirroring `test:forced-colors`.
- [ ] Remove the matching bullet from `doc/spec/new-component-checklist.md` § Known limits.

## 2. Compact-preset regression project

Goal: prove controls actually shrink under density compact mode. The per-component
`x-density` probe shrinks seed tokens one at a time; nothing tests the whole preset.

- [ ] Add a `compact` project to `src/test/playwright/playwright.config.ts`.
- [ ] New spec: render pages twice — default vs `data-density="compact"` on the host
      (per `doc/spec/data-dense-mode.md`; alternatively load the `doc/marble-compact.css`
      tuning preset) — and assert rendered control heights (button, textbox, combobox,
      listbox row) drop by the ladder delta from `tokens/_sizing.css`.
- [ ] Remove the matching bullet from `doc/spec/new-component-checklist.md` § Known limits.

## 3. render-smoke auto-discovery

Goal: stop hand-maintaining the `PAGES` list — new preview pages should be
smoke-tested automatically, like `gallery-scan.spec.ts` already does.

- [ ] Convert `src/test/playwright/render-smoke.spec.ts` from the hardcoded `PAGES`
      array to auto-discovery of `src/test/resources/web/*.zul` (reuse/share the
      discovery + SKIP-set helper from `gallery-scan.spec.ts`).
- [ ] Keep an explicit SKIP set for pages that are not standalone.
- [ ] Then delete bookkeeping item 3 (render-smoke `PAGES`) from
      `doc/spec/new-component-checklist.md` § Orchestrator bookkeeping gate AND the
      matching item in `doc/orchestrator-playbook.md` Step 4c (renumber), plus the
      Known-limits bullet — the obligation becomes automatic.

## 4. Evaluator migration to Playwright (capture + measurement)

Goal: remove the Chrome-MCP single point of failure (a `gif_creator` tab-group desync
once stalled Gate 2), get deterministic waits, and lift the 4-parallel-evaluator
Chrome-tab cap.

- [ ] Map the evaluator's ready-state gate to Playwright waits
      (`domcontentloaded` + per-page marker + `document.fonts.ready` — same recipe as
      the usecase screenshot specs; never `networkidle`, ZK AU keeps the connection busy).
- [ ] Replace `javascript_tool` computed-style measurement with `page.evaluate` in a
      parametrized helper under `src/test/playwright/` (disable CSS transitions before
      measuring border-color/box-shadow).
- [ ] Capture per-matrix artefacts via Playwright screenshots into `doc/screenshots/<comp>/`.
- [ ] Rewrite `.claude/agents/zk-theme-evaluator.md` §3/§3a/§3b + Tools lists: drop
      Chrome-MCP, allow Playwright runs. The existing §3a Playwright screenshot
      fallback is the seed of this migration.
- [ ] Raise the parallel-evaluator cap in `doc/orchestrator-playbook.md` Step 2 /
      Parallel execution rules accordingly.

## 5. Generator batch-build parallelism (conditional — do NOT do preemptively)

Trigger: only if Generator strict serialization becomes the throughput bottleneck
(it is not today — most rows are VERIFIED and Generator dispatches are rare).

- [ ] Generators become edit-only: skip `npm run build:css` in the Generator.
- [ ] The orchestrator runs ONE build per batch after all Generators of the batch return.
- [ ] On build failure, attribute by bisect (rebuild with half the diffs applied).
- [ ] Update `.claude/agents/zk-theme-generator.md` (build step + Tools) and
      `doc/orchestrator-playbook.md` Step 5/6 (serial-dispatch rule).

## 6. `.z-label` re-declares what it already inherits (deferred to P4)

Deferred to P4 by the user on 2026-09-11 (chat decision D6). This is shipped theme CSS
touching every Label in every ZK app, so it does not belong in a preview-only change.

Goal: delete the redundant declarations on `.z-label` so typography and colour set on a
container reach the text, instead of adding paired utility classes to work around it.

### The finding

`.z-label` (`zul/src/main/resources/web/js/zul/wgt/css/label.css`, the rule at the top of
the `zk-components` layer) declares five properties. All five reproduce what the Label
would otherwise inherit from `body` (`zul/src/main/resources/web/zul/css/base/_reset.css`):

| Property | `body` sets | `.z-label` sets | |
|---|---|---|---|
| `font-family` | `var(--zk-typescale-font-family)` | `var(--zk-typescale-font-family)` | token-identical |
| `font-size` | `var(--zk-typescale-body-medium-size)` | `var(--zk-typescale-body-medium-size)` | token-identical |
| `font-weight` | `var(--zk-typescale-body-medium-weight)` | `var(--zk-typescale-body-medium-weight)` | token-identical |
| `line-height` | `var(--zk-typescale-body-medium-line-height)` | `var(--zk-typescale-body-medium-line-height)` | token-identical |
| `color` | `var(--zk-color-on-background)` | `var(--zk-color-on-surface)` | different token, **same value** `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.87)` |

So in the default case the rule changes nothing. Its only effect is to block every
contextual override: an element's own declaration beats an inherited value, and
inheritance is not a cascade competitor, so `@layer` order and specificity are irrelevant.
ZK wraps raw text in a `zul.wgt.Label`, so this hits any text inside a styled container.

Both `git log` and the file itself carry no rationale — the rule arrived wholesale with
`2100200284` ("replace the LESS theme pipeline with the Marble CSS sources"), so treat it
as migration residue, not a considered decision, until evidence says otherwise.

### Why it is worth doing

- It is the root cause of the 52 remaining dead text colours (chat D6): a `z-bg-*` class
  sets `background-color` **and** `color` in one rule; the background belongs on the
  wrapper and the colour on the label, so the class cannot move. Deleting `.z-label`'s
  `color` fixes all 52 with **no new classes and no paired-class API**.
- The alternative considered and rejected was adding five utilities —
  `.z-text-on-primary-container`, `.z-text-on-secondary-container`,
  `.z-text-on-surface-variant`, `.z-text-on-success-container`,
  `.z-text-on-error-container` (none exist today; only `.z-text-on-primary` and
  `.z-text-on-surface` do). Rejected because it forces authors to remember that
  `z-bg-X` and `z-text-on-X` are a pair, which is the thing MD3's container/on-container
  pairing exists to avoid.
- The same logic covers the four font properties. Had `.z-label` not declared them,
  commit `47d26068ed` (1223 typography rewrites across 142 preview pages) would not have
  been necessary — those wrappers would simply have worked. That commit is still correct
  authoring per `reference/zul-authoring.md` and should stay; it is just symptom-level.

### Scope of the 52 occurrences

Counted after `47d26068ed` in `zkpreview/src/main/webapp/web/**/*.zul`:

| Wrapper class | Count | Example page |
|---|---|---|
| `z-bg-primary-container` | 44 | `dnd.zul`, `utility/spacing.zul` |
| `z-bg-secondary-container` | 4 | `utility/responsive.zul` |
| `z-bg-surface-variant` | 2 | `dnd.zul` |
| `z-bg-success-container` | 1 | `utility/print.zul` |
| `z-bg-error-container` | 1 | `utility/zindex.zul` |

Severity is **fidelity, not accessibility**: those container backgrounds sit at lightness
0.87–0.92 and the wrongly-inherited `on-surface` is 87% black, so contrast passes. What is
lost is MD3's colour semantics — five semantic containers all render the same neutral grey
text instead of their paired hue.

`z-bg-*` has no consumer outside the preview pages: zero hits in `zul/`, `zkmax` and
`zkex` component CSS (`button.css` mentions `.z-bg-*` only in a comment) and zero in
`zktest`.

### Steps

- [ ] Stage 1 — delete only `color: var(--zk-color-on-surface);` from `.z-label`. This is
      the minimal change that closes D6. Verify before going further.
- [ ] Stage 2 — only if stage 1 is clean, evaluate deleting the four font properties too,
      which is what would make container typography work generally.
- [ ] Audit what currently relies on `.z-label` *resetting* an inherited colour — a Label
      inside any component that sets its own `color` will start following that colour.
      Grep component CSS for rules that set `color` on a container whose content is a
      Label (chips, badges, coloured panel captions, selected rows, filled buttons).
- [ ] If a component genuinely needs its Labels pinned, fix it at that component's own
      selector, not by restoring the theme-global declaration.

### Verification bar

Run against a preview app on a free port (`cd zkpreview && ./start.sh <port>`; never
assume 8085 is free — other sessions use it, and zkpreview serves the live working tree):

- [ ] `probe.js` on a `z-bg-*` wrapper: the inner `.z-label` computes the container's
      paired `on-*` colour rather than `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.87)`.
- [ ] Playwright, all projects that passed for `47d26068ed`: `smoke` (115), `framework`
      (7), `responsive` (4), `print` (2), `zindex` (2), and `gallery` (82).
- [ ] `gallery` will legitimately move on pages whose text colour changes — regenerate
      only those baselines, and use bare `--update-snapshots` (preset `changed` in
      @playwright/test 1.59.x), never `=all`, which rewrites all 82.
- [ ] `cd zktest && ./gradlew test` — this is shipped CSS, so the component suites matter
      here in a way they did not for a preview-only change.
- [ ] Check both themes and `forced-colors`; `_forced-colors.css` overrides colour
      independently and must still win.

### Cross-references

- Chat decision D6, 2026-09-11 — deferred to P4 rather than done inline.
- `47d26068ed` — the preview-side sweep; its commit message records the 41-vs-52 count
  correction and the `z-bg-*` carve-out.
- `.claude/skills/marble-theme/reference/zul-authoring.md` § "ZK wraps raw text in a Label"
  — states the authoring rule; update it if stage 2 lands, since the rule's premise
  changes.
- `.claude/skills/marble-theme/SKILL.md` rule 5: "When a theme-global invention collides
  with a ZK JS assumption, the first option to evaluate is *deleting the invention*." That
  is the principle this item applies.

## 7. Generate the utility class index page

Goal: publish the human-readable catalogue of the `z-*` utility classes, generated from the
same manifest the IDE plugin reads, so prose documentation can never drift from the CSS.

This is Phase 3 of `doc/utility-class-discovery.md`. It was deliberately held until the naming
review landed — generating it earlier would have published names that were about to change.
That blocker is now gone: the names are final and `doc/spec/utility-naming.md` is normative.

- [ ] Generate `doc/spec/utility-index.md` from
      `zul/codegen/resources/web/zul/css/utility-classes.json`, the way
      `scripts/build-css.js --emit-docs` already generates `doc/spec/icon-index.md`.
      Group by the manifest's `category` field; show each class's `css` string.
- [ ] Carry the breakpoint note: a trailing `-sm/-md/-lg/-xl` is always a SIZE; breakpoints
      are infixes (`z-d-md-none`). Readers coming from the old suffix form will look for
      `z-d-none-md` and must be told where it went.
- [ ] Point `.claude/skills/marble-theme/reference/zul-authoring.md` at the generated index
      instead of at the raw `utility/` CSS directory.
- [ ] Add the CI guard the discovery doc describes: assert every class in the manifest
      resolves in the built `norm.css.dsp`. Note the drift risk it worried about does not
      exist — the manifest regenerates into the gitignored `codegen/` tree on every build,
      so it cannot fall behind. The *coverage* guard is the one still worth having.

### Cross-references

- `doc/utility-class-discovery.md` § Phase 3 — the original plan; D3 there settled that there
  is no `description` field, so the `css` string is the hover text.

- `b1a4a0e31c` — the commit that made those rules normative.

## 8. Regenerate the stale screenshot baselines

**Done 2026-10-06** (Jess review prerequisite, rulings D19-A to D25-A). 33 baselines regenerated
after per-image review, the organigram and tree/listbox row forced-colors focus checks fixed in the
test, the `chromium` threshold tightened to 0.05 and 4 dropdown/chip shots added. Verifier verdict
PASS: `doc/jess-review/gates/baseline-verify.md`. Plan and rulings: the baseline sections of
`doc/jess-review/jess-review-verification-plan.md`.

Goal: get `screenshot.spec.ts` and `focus-ring-scan.spec.ts` back to green, so a real
regression is visible instead of being buried under 28 known failures.

**This is not caused by the utility renames.** It was proven by A/B: the same 28 failures occur
on `15bc0c7eeb`, the commit before that series, with the preview app rebuilt and restarted on
each side. The baselines under `zkpreview/doc/screenshots/` were last regenerated 2026-09-12,
before the LESS-to-Marble CSS pipeline replacement (`2100200284`) and everything after it.

- [x] Confirm the 28 are all stale-baseline, not real defects — inspect the diff images in
      `test-results/` before accepting any of them. A genuinely broken component would hide
      in this set perfectly.
- [x] Regenerate with bare `--update-snapshots` (preset `changed`), never `=all`.
- [x] 26 are `[chromium] screenshot.spec.ts` gallery + hover/focus shots; 2 are
      `[focus-scan]` forced-colors assertions (`tree: tree row`, `organigram: organigram
      node`) which are **assertion** failures, not image diffs — those two need a real fix
      or an explicit waiver, not a regenerated image. Correction (2026-10-06): `tree: tree row`
      did not really pass after the #41/#43 fix; it passed only because it, too, sampled a
      mid-transition blend. With transitions disabled it fails, because the test still forces
      `:focus-visible` on the `.z-treerow` itself, a state ZK never produces (the row ring is
      gated on the tree's `.z-focus-a:focus-visible` since #43). In the real state the ring is
      HighlightText on Highlight. See the baseline section of
      `doc/jess-review/jess-review-verification-plan.md`.
- [ ] Beware: `forced-colors-gallery.spec.ts` is a visual-review spec that **rewrites** ~100
      tracked PNGs on every run. Revert those before staging unless they are the point of
      the commit.

## 9. A truncated tab label never shows an ellipsis

Found while verifying Jess #52 (2026-10-06, user ruling D14-A: tracked here, not part of #52).

`.z-tab-text` declares `overflow: hidden; text-overflow: ellipsis; white-space: nowrap`, but it is
a flex item of `.z-tab-content` (itself a flex item of `li.z-tab`) and neither carries
`min-width: 0`, so the label never shrinks below its content width. With a fixed narrow tab width
the label keeps its full width, `li.z-tab`'s `overflow: hidden` clips it on both sides, and no
ellipsis appears. Measured after the #52 fix: a 219px label in a 60px tab is shown as a centred
middle slice. The pre-fix rules have the same structure, so this is inferred to predate #52; it
has not been measured on the pre-fix tree.

- [ ] Confirm on the pre-fix tree (or accept the inference from the rule structure).
- [ ] Let the label shrink (`min-width: 0` on `.z-tab-content` and `.z-tab-text`) and check that
      the #52 indicator, which is sized from `.z-tab-content`'s padding, still matches the
      visible label width once the label is truncated.

## 10. Chosenbox dropdown option hover is a hardcoded black 4% fill

Found while adding the dropdown screenshots for D22-B (2026-10-06).

`zkcml/zkmax/src/main/resources/web/js/zkmax/inp/css/chosenbox.css:147-150` paints
`.z-chosenbox-option:hover, .z-chosenbox-option-hover` with `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.04)`. That class is
also the keyboard-highlighted option (ArrowDown in the open dropdown). Three problems:

- It is a literal colour, against the "no hardcoded colour values" rule; no token or knob reaches it.
- Black at 4% disappears on a dark surface, so the dark preset has no visible keyboard highlight.
- MD3's hover state layer is `on-surface` at 8%; 4% is half of that.

Batch 2 (#23) did not cover it: its chosenbox knob `--zk-chosenbox-item-focus-bg` is the fill of a
clicked **chip** in the input, not of a dropdown option.

- [ ] Decide the state for a keyboard-highlighted option (hover state layer, or the list-row
      family's `secondary-container` as combobox uses) and route it through a token.
- [ ] Check the dark preset.

## 11. A long column label is covered by the sort icon (and the menu button)

Found while verifying Jess #35/#39 (batch 3, 2026-10-07; user ruling D34-A: tracked here, no theme change).

After #39 the grid sort icon is `position: absolute` at the right end of the header cell, so it no longer pushes the label. A label that fills a narrow column is drawn under the icon (and under the hover column-menu button) with no ellipsis, because `.z-column-content` is a block inside the `th` and carries no overflow rule.

An application can fix it with ellipsis plus room for the icons:

```css
.z-column-content { overflow: hidden; text-overflow: ellipsis; white-space: nowrap; padding-right: 22px; }
.z-column:has(.z-column-button) .z-column-content { padding-right: 50px; }
```

Measured on the Basic grid, Author column at 130px: ellipsis alone still leaves the icon on top of the text; ellipsis plus padding stops the text before the icon.

- [ ] Decide whether the theme should ship this for sortable columns. Cost: `align="center"` sortable columns shift left by half the padding, so header text no longer centres over the body text.

## 12. Frozen divider is missing in the body under forced-colors

`forced-colors: active` strips `box-shadow`, so the `inset -1px` body divider added for Jess #37 does not paint; the header divider survives through its border. Same result as before the fix (0 rows), not a regression.

- [ ] Add a forced-colors rule that draws the body divider with a border (`ButtonBorder` / `CanvasText`).

## 13. Header text is 4px off the body text in listbox and tree

Found while measuring Jess #39: listbox and tree show the same 4px offset in non-first columns (first columns vary with indentation and structure). #39 only fixed the grid header (`.z-column-sorticon`); `.z-listheader` and `.z-treecol` have their own sort icon rules.

- [ ] Measure and fix the listbox and tree headers with the same method.
- [ ] Frozen-cell hover alpha is 0.9896 in listbox and tree (0.9948 in grid), so a scrolled-under label shows through very faintly. Pre-existing; the batch 3 gate accepts alpha >= 0.98.


## 14. The tablet grid gallery shows a broken frozen header

Found while classifying the batch 3 baselines (2026-10-07; user ruling D38-A: baseline regenerated anyway, tracked here).

In `grid-tablet.png` the "Col B" and "Col C" headers overlap at x=433, the header underline has a gap, and the header boundary is at x=633 while the body boundary is at x=432. This was already in the committed baseline before batch 3, so the baseline stores a broken picture and will differ again when it is fixed.

- [ ] Find why the frozen header is laid out differently at the tablet viewport (header boundary 633 vs body 432).
- [ ] Regenerate `grid-tablet.png` once fixed.

### Cross-references

- `doc/jess-review/gates/batch3-baseline.md`, `sbs-grid-tablet.png`.

## 15. No screenshot covers a sorted column header

None of the 5 gallery screenshots shows a sort icon (0 of 85 headers), so the Jess #35 change (arrow glyph) and the #39 icon position are not protected by the screenshot tests. Same kind of gap as the dropdown screenshots added for D22-B.

- [ ] Add a screenshot of a grid header with one column sorted ascending and one descending (Basic grid, real clicks).

## 16. Custom scrollbar thumbs are invisible under forced-colors

Found while verifying Jess #78 (batch 4, 2026-10-07). Under `forced-colors: active` the biglistbox thumb and the `zul.Scrollbar` embed rail both render as the page background (centre pixel equals the background), because both are painted with `background-color`, which the browser forces to Canvas. Same family as item 12.

- [ ] Give the thumbs a forced-colors rule (`ButtonBorder` / `CanvasText` fill or a border).

## 17. The tablet baselines for slider and calendar are stale

Found while classifying batch 4 (2026-10-07; user ruling D42-A: not part of the Jess batch). `slider-tablet.png` has not been regenerated since `64f1c07b9d` (vertical slider default height), and `calendar-tablet.png` since `778b5a809f` (datebox follows `cols`). The `tablet` project fails on both until someone regenerates them through the usual classify → confirmation page → approve flow.

- [ ] Regenerate `slider-tablet.png` and `calendar-tablet.png` (by the work that owns those commits).
- [ ] A commit that changes a component's CSS should run the `tablet` project, including pages that embed the component.

## 18. Untested corners of the biglistbox scrollbar

Batch 4 did not cover: the touch variant (`zkmax/css/tablet/_scrollbar.css`), `frozenCols` / `fixFrozenCols` combinations (the page's dropdowns need the composer to fill), and `doc/spec/DESIGN.md` has no biglistbox scrollbar paragraph (section 15 covers only the native and `zul.Scrollbar` bars).

- [ ] Measure the touch variant and a `frozenCols` biglistbox against the batch 4 checks.
- [ ] Decide whether DESIGN.md needs a biglistbox scrollbar note.

## 19. The tablet scrollable menubar overflows its bar

Found while regenerating `menubar-tablet.png` (2026-10-09, D63; commit `8cc85e8a6c`). In the "Scrollable Menubar" block at the tablet viewport, items 3–5 run past the end of the grey bar and there are no scroll arrows. The desktop gallery (`menubar-gallery.png`) shows the same block correctly (arrows, clipped items). It may be how the tablet layout has always behaved or a regression; the regenerated baseline now stores the current picture.

- [ ] Find out whether the tablet picture is intended (compare with the baseline before `221d6ed74b` and with the touch scroll behaviour).
- [ ] If it is a defect, fix it and regenerate `menubar-tablet.png`.

## 20. Stray closing brace in `checkbox.css`

Found while reading the switch section for Jess #10 (batch 12, 2026-10-09). `zul/.../wgt/css/checkbox.css` ends with an extra `}` after the toggle disabled rules (around line 580). Not caused by batch 12 and not checked for build impact.

- [ ] Check whether the brace is really stray (an unclosed block earlier in the file) and whether the CSS build or minifier hides it.

## 21. Switch follow-ups left after the MD3 change

Jess #10 (batch 12) made `mold="switch"` follow MD3. Left out on purpose:

- The check mark inside the thumb (optional in MD3, shown in the designer's picture).
- `tokens/_forced-colors.css` still carries the old switch rules (1px track border, `CanvasText` thumb). The forced-colors suite passes; it is a shared file, so any rule change needs a ruling first.
- The off-state thumb uses `--zk-color-on-surface-variant` instead of MD3's `outline` (reason: 1.41:1 against the track with Marble's light outline token). Revisit if the outline token gets darker.

- [ ] Decide whether the thumb icon is wanted.
- [ ] Re-check the forced-colors rules for the 52×32 track.

## 22. The outline and surface-container tokens are light on white

Measured for Jess #10 (batch 12). The switch track border is 2.13:1 against a white page (the `--zk-color-outline` token on white is 1.74:1) and the off-state track fill is 1.23:1. WCAG 1.4.11 asks 3:1 for the boundary of a control, so this affects every control that draws its boundary with `--zk-color-outline`, not only the switch.

- [ ] Decide whether Marble's `--zk-color-outline` should be darker (design call; touches many components).

## 23. `grid-paging` gallery flipped between runs

`gallery › grid-paging` failed in the merge-1 regression (2026-10-09) and passed in the batch 12 regression the same day. Someone may have regenerated `grid-paging-gallery.png` in between; the 1% pixel tolerance may also hide it.

- [ ] Confirm which commit regenerated it, or whether the test is flaky.
